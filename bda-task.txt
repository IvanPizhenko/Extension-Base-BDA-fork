Currently, BDA's log file includes: 
- year
- initiation cell coordinates
- total event size (number of sites)
- number of damaged sites
- number of cohorts killed total
- mean BDA severity across all sites

Every cohort in the Biomass Succession extension is defined by age and species.
Can you have the log file also output the "total biomass" of the cohorts killed by species for every infestation event?
Note: This modification will not need to be merged into BDA's GitHub repository.
